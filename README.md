## Introduction

EVA is no longer a custom Windows ISO. Instead, I have created a guide in hope of teaching you how to create your own ISO, optimize other aspects of your setup & overall point you in the correct direction in terms of resources. Nothing in this guide is branded, I have chosen to use the old project's name so that it acts as a direct replacement to the pre-made image which is no longer available. Please do not ask for it or trust other sources as they have been recreated with malicious content by other people

Some elements of this guide are not directly performance related & are personal preference as I cover configuring the operating system from start to finish. I have tried my best to provide technical references, evidence, my own research & a valid justification to the information provided to prevent making changes that would otherwise make your system perform worse than stock but simultaneously also provide a solid baseline for experimenting with other settings in the future

The guidance is currently updated & have been tested on Windows 7 through to Windows 10. Configuring Windows 11 with this guide currently has major issues
